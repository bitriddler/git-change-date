# git-change-date

If you're looking at this, you're probably an imbecile incapable of using or even learning how to use `git`.

There's a fucking `--date` parameter to the `commit` command you absolute fucking retard.

Stop using or even making shitty nodejs tools for absolute idiots. They have to learn or die.

Thank you.
